# Tapis Systems Migrate Job

Files:
  README_migratejob - this file
  migratejob-dryrun.yml - k8s file for dry-run of migrate job
  migratejob-dryrun.sh  - script to launch k8s dry-run job
  migratejob-apply.yml - k8s file for run of migrate job with changes applied
  migratejob-apply.sh  - script to launch k8s migrate job with changes applied
  systems-config.yml - snapshot of service config file from DEV environment. Used in scripts.

NOTE: These files are being kept in the tapis-systems repo for now so they are backed up
      and version controlled. In future they possibly should go into tapis-deployer repo.

This directory contains kubernetes deployment files and other files for running an on-demand job
to perform java based non-DB migration steps for the Tapis Systems service.
 
Process and files are based on tapis-kube/skadmin

There is no burnup/burndown since it will be a k8s job only run on-demand.

The job starts up in the same manner as the Systems service api application.
Typically it is run only once, although significant effort should be made to
ensure that each incarnation of this job is idempotent since it may have to
be run more than once if there are issues.

In general the Systems service api should be shut down before running this job but that
may not always be true depending on the migration steps.

The job output (the logs) should be checked to confirm there were no errors.

Following env variables must be set:
  TAPIS_SITE_ID
  TAPIS_SERVICE_PASSWORD
  TAPIS_TENANT_SVC_BASEURL
  TAPIS_DB_JDBC_URL
  TAPIS_DB_USER
  TAPIS_DB_PASSWORD
Following services from a running tapis3 are required: tenants, tokens, security-kernel


Version 1.2.0
===============
The initial version of this job is for Tapis Systems version 1.2.0 or possibly
later if version 1.2.0 is never installed and the old version is pre-1.2.0 and
the new version is post-1.2.0.  
It migrates all Systems secrets to a path that include "static" or "dynamic" in the path name.
The job makes calls to the Systems DB, Tenants and SK.
NOTES:
* It is not necesarry to shut down the service when running this job.
* This version of the migration job has been run in dryrun mode against Systems version
  1.1.3 and 1.2.0 with no errors.
* This version has been successfully tested in DEV and STG environments.

## Running the job

To make a dry-run of the job use migratejob-dryrun.sh

Check the logs to make sure all went all.

If you need to re-run the job delete the current job first using kubectl delete -f migratejob-dryrun.yml
