Tapis Systems Service

There are three primary branches: *local*, *dev*, and *main*.

All changes should first be made in the branch *local*.

When it is time to deploy to the **DEV** kubernetes environment
run the jenkins job TapisJava->3_ManualBuildDeploy->systems.

This job will:
* Merge changes from *local* to *dev*
* Build, tag and push docker images
* Deploy to **DEV** environment
* Push the merged *local* changes to the *dev* branch.

To move docker images from **DEV** to **STAGING** run the following jenkins job:
* TapisJava->2_Release->promote-dev-to-staging

To move docker images from **STAGING** to **PROD** run the following jenkins job:
* TapisJava->2_Release->promote-staging-to-prod-ver
